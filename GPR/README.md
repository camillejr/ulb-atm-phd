# Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)

The content of this repository was developed mostly thanks to a great [lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpsV1y6wMQ8) by Professor Anna Scaife [1] and insights from probably the best textbook in the subject of GPR [3]. Other wonderful resources for studying Gaussian Processes are listed in the **Bibliography** section below.
