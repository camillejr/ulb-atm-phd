# Generate and populate `.tex` files

This is a Python template that can be adjusted to generate and populate `.tex` files with content.

As it is, it is mostly suitable to adjust for populating with figures that have some pattern to their filenames.

Then, in your master `.tex` file you can `\input{}` the populated files.
