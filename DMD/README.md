# Dynamic Mode Decomposition

**Dynamic Mode Decomposition** (DMD) is a data-driven method for approximating a generally nonlinear dynamical system with a linear one. It can be used for finding low-rank structures in multi-dimensional data sets, as well as predicting the future state of the system with inference made solely from the collected data.

This directory contains knowledge on DMD as well as related code.

## Notes on Dynamic Mode Decomposition

Check out my notes on the theory of DMD, which for now is not complete but hopefully will be someday ;)
