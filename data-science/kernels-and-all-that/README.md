# Kernels and kernel methods

Kernel is a measure of similarity between two vectors. It is a function that takes two variables as an input and maps them onto a single real number.

## Things to do with a kernel

You may look at a kernel function as a generalisation of a dot product. This leads to the next logical step: _covariance matrix_, since the covariance matrix is populated with all possible dot products between n vectors.
