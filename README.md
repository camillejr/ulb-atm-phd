Since September 2018 I am a PhD researcher at Universit√© libre de Bruxelles. The main focus of my PhD project is on developing reduced-order, predictive tools for modeling turbulent reactive flows. My work aims to support the implementation of novel combustion technologies that combine high efficiency, fuel flexibility and very low pollutant emissions.
